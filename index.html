                    Well I guess this isn't specifcally about me but look it's my cat Zach! Isn't he so cute? 
                    <br>I also have my cat Jade. 
                    <br>Jade is a <i>curious</i> cat and Zach is a <b>scaredy</b> cat.
            
                    <br>Here's also a picture of Jade!

                <br>Anyway back to me, I suppose. I want to get into web development. I think it's a very interesting sounding job. 
                <br>Everyone needs a website nowadays so I want to be someone that can make one!

        Though I must admit, web development wasn't my first job choice. If I had it my dream way, I would be a musician or a voice actress. I love to sing, and I've
        always admired voice actors.
        <br>
        Here's a clip of me voice acting in ZylerWorries4u's series,
